For your Nosana node, you can see your available pulls on docker by typing  ./dpc.sh
Before it will work, you'll need to copy and paste the following text into your command line interface, all at once, and just once. It will also automatically chmod +x dpc.sh

This will create the dpc.sh script file and not leave any installation script on your drive.

It will require you to enter your password and click y a couple times.
There is nothing in the script to edit, you will not have to add any informaion. You can remember the ./dpc.sh command better as:
Docker Pull Count  (./dpc.sh)

After dropping the code into your Command Line Interface, simply type:
./dpc.sh
whenever you wish to see your available Docker Pull Count.
