You can see your docker pull rate limit by typing  ./dpc.sh
Before it will work, you'll need to copy and paste the following text into your command line interface, all at once, and just once.
This will create the dpc.sh script file and not leave any installation script on your drive.
It will require you to enter your password and click ***Y*** a couple times.
There is nothing in the script to edit, you will not have to add any informaion. You can remember the command better as:
Docker Pull Count  (./dpc.sh)
After dropping the code into your Command Line Interface, simply type:
./dpc.sh
whenever you wish to see your available Docker Pull Count.
